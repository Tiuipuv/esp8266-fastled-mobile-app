# esp8266-fastled-mobile-app
A react native app, originally built for CS 404 classwork.
This app is a replacement for the web front end of [my other repo](https://github.com/Tiuipuv/esp8266-fastled-dedicated-webserver).


## Running locally
The following scripts are available and scaffolded out by expo:
 * `npm start`: run the expo server, making the app available in development mode (generic)
 * `npm run android`: run the expo server specifically for android devices
 * `npm run ios`: run the expo server specifically for ios devices (untested)
 * `npm run web`: run the expo server specifically for web (untested)
 * `npm run eject`: debundles all of expos required packages. we do not plan on doing this at any time.
